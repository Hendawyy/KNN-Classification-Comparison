# K-Nearest Neighbors Classification Comparison

This Python project explores the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification algorithm by comparing its performance with different distance metrics. Additionally, it evaluates the impact of data normalization on classification results.

## Dataset
The project uses a dataset provided in the 'crxdataReducedClean.csv' file. This dataset is preprocessed and includes columns labeled 'col0' through 'col9'.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/Hendawyy/KNN-Classification-Comparison
```


2. Install the required Python libraries, including Pandas and NumPy:
```
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
```


3. Run the provided Python script to perform KNN classification with different distance metrics and evaluate the results.

## Structure
The project is structured as follows:
- `knn_classification.py`: The main Python script for KNN classification using different distance metrics.
- `crxdataReducedClean.csv`: The dataset used for classification.
- `README.md`: This README file.

## Usage
Modify the script as needed, and run it to compare KNN classification with various distance metrics and with or without data normalization.

## Results
The project provides insights into the performance of KNN classification, showing accuracy, confusion matrices, and classification reports for different distance metrics and normalization scenarios.
